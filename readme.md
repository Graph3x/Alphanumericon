"The die is cast" said Caesar Cypher as he crossed Alphanumericon... or something like that

WHAT IS ALPHANUMERICON?
Very basic language that uses only alphanumerical characters (letters and numbers).
It does not have any real usecases.

Alphanumericon is written in Python3 and it can be both compiled ( to .ll) or interpreted.
The interpreter is more up to date than the compiler.
